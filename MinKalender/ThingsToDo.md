**Handling of All-Day Events:** Implement a solution for handling all-day events. Consider using a half-day box overlay in grey to distinguish them.

**Text Size Flexibility:** Implement fluid and adjustable text sizing. Users should have the option to customize the text size to their preference.

**Additional Settings:** Add more settings to the application, such as options for text case (uppercase/lowercase), text size adjustments, and DayView background customization.

**Design Enhancement:** Enhance the overall design to achieve a more aesthetic and clean look. Aim for an Apple-like design with a focus on aesthetics.

**Create an Icon:** Design and create an icon for the application.

**Structural Refinements:** Consider restructuring the application for improved organization and maintainability. The current structure may have evolved incrementally and could benefit from a more deliberate design.

**Performance Optimization:** Perform a comprehensive review of the entire application to identify and address any memory leaks, performance issues, and opportunities for optimization.
