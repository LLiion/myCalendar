# myCalendar

I'm making myself a more readable calendar, with less distractions and a day-timer to keep track of the day.

There is definitely more to do, i'm using my TODO-file to remember.

And sorry for all swedish comments, use google translate or something if there is any reason for you to use my code.

Anyhow, this app is reading the calendars logged in to on your device, and presents the daily tasks in a more clean way. It is created for my ipad 1:st gen on xcode 11/13. Wut? Cus that one I can put on the wall and use solely for this.

I'm thinking no one really would need this code, but if you have a relative with dementia or kids with asd/adhd perhaps this is a starting point.
